 * that simplifies the writing of embedded scripts in applications.
 *
 * Instead of programming the raw process of loading a main module
 * through a process, then launching it in the executor process, this
 * executor-in-a-box can take care of loading or evaluating scripts from
 * VFS (virtual file systems) or texts.

    *   an CodeError instance, and thrownError() is 0.
    * - If the context exits on a raised error, thrownError() is nonzero and completionError() is the same.
    * - If something external (third party code, WVMExtension) explicitly calls completeWithError(),
    *   thrownError() is zero and raisedItem() is nil.
