/** Core falcon string representation.
   This is a string as seen by the VM and its fellows (module loader, module and so on).
   As times goes by, it will substitute ever c_string and Hstring ( stl++ string + falcon
   allocator), so it must be small and efficient, and support different allocation schemes
   seamlessly.

   Strings are polymorphic; that is, they always occupy the same amount of space,
   independently of the kind (being the string deep data pointed by a pointer in
   the class), so that the type of a string may be changed without the need to
   reallocate it. So, if/when more than one item are pointing to the core string object,
   and the core string changes, the new status is immediately reflected to all the pointing
   items. This wastes a little bit of allocation space on every string, but speeds up the
   engine notably.

/** Core string utility namespace.
   Core strings cannot be virtual classes. This is because core strings
   may be polimorphic; some operations may change the very nature of
   core strings. In example, read-only static strings will be turned to
   memory buffers in case of write operations. Chunked strings may be
   turned into sequential buffers, and the other way around.
   Re-creating them with a new() operator would not provide a viable solution
   as all the other data must stay the same.

   For this reason, a manager class hyerarcy is provided. Every core string
   has a manager, (which is actually a pointer to a pure-virtual class with
   no data), and every operation on a string is an inline call to the manager
   class. So, the string virtuality is externalized in the manager.

   With a "standard" compiler optimization this is 100% equivalent to have a
   pointer to a table of function, but actually faster as the offset of the
   virtual table is calculated at compile time in every situation.

/** Core string
   This class is called "Core String" because it represents the strings as the internal VM and engine
   sees them. This class is highly configurable and may manage any string that Falcon will ever need
   to mangle with.

   A set of fields is used to store the informations about the memory buffer where the string is
   actually held. The "kind" of string is determined by its manager. The manager is a special friend
   class that is in charge to effect all the needed operations on a particular kind of string. In
   example, there's a manager for static C strings, one for memAlloc() allocated strings, and in
   future also for chunked (multi buffer) stings and a parallel set of managers for international
   strings.

   The kind of the string can be changed by just changing its manager; this is often done automatically
   by an appropriate constructor or when some operation occour (i.e. a static string may be turned into
   a chunked one at write operations, and a chunked may get transformed into a buffered one if a linear
   access on the whole string is needed.

   String have a set of specialized subclasses which actually does nothing if not construct the
   base String with the appropriate string manager. Every corestring class is BOUND having not
   any private data member, because the derived String may be turned in something else at every moment
   without changing its memory position or layout. There's no RTTI information about this changes; all
   the polimorphism needed is applied by changing the string manager.

   However, String sublcass may define some new function members to handle initialization steps
   before "unmasking" the String structure and handle it back to the rest of the system. Also,
   as the String subclass may be determined by looking at the manager, a subclass with special
   operations (new member function) may be casted later on safely. The only requisite is that there's a 1:1
   mapping between corestring subclasses and the manager they use.
