/** The Falcon virtual machine.

   Virtual machine is in charge to execute Falcon bytecode.

   The virtual machine execution model is quite flexible, and allow infinite execution,
   step-by-step execution, limited runs and interrupts (event rising and debug requests)
   from external code while running.

   To run, the Virtual Machine needs to be properly setup. However, this "setup steps" are
   thought as customization steps so that the VM user is able to configure it
   on its needs, and they are both simple and effective.

   Minimal configuration needed requires to add a Runtime object, which holds the lists of
   all non-main modules. It is then possible to execute a routine exported by any of the
   modules in the runtime, or to provide a "running module", or "main module" with the
   setup() method. Once the startup symbol, or running module (or both) are set, the
   it is possible to call run().

   \note It is possible that this interface will be simplified in the future so that only one
      method is used to set up the runtime and the start symbol or main module.


   \note This class implements the error handler interface because it may act as an
      error handler for the embedding components: compiler, assembler, module loader
      and runtime may all be embedded in a VM that may act as a referee for the
      script to be i.e. evaluating correctly a piece of falcon source code.

      return private symbols that will be used just in this occasion and won't enter

      by providing them directly. However, subclasses creating directly symbols
      must still create them inside a FlexyModule and use linkCompleteSymbol
      to bless the symbol in the VM.
