1 Abstract 
~~~~~~~~~~~

This directory contains a skeleton Falcon Module. The module defines a
minimal module meant as a minimal development base to help speed up
module writing startup phase.

2 Comment on the skeleton structure 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The skeleton module is divided into several files to provide better
customizability:

skeleton.cpp - Entry point of the dynamic library.

skeleton_fm.cpp/.h - Module main file. Here, the Module subclass is defined.

skeleton_mod.cpp/.h - this files declare and define the module internal
   logic. If the module is extremely simple, or if it has not an internal
   logic that may be exported or treated separately with resepect to the
   extension functions, you may remove this files.

Other than these, there are project files/make files working on the supported
platform, and a set of "template" files to be used when creating new sources.

3 Generating your new module from the skeleton 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is done by Falconeer, a Falcon script that is shipped with
development packages of every supported platform.

On systems provided with "man" utility a falconeer.fal man page is shipped
with every Falcon installation; in other systems, you may load the script
without arguments to have a short inline help.

The script changes the names of the modules, and the supported development
platforms project settings so to match the project name that you have set.

Once configured with Falconeer, the module in this directory may be
immediately compiled and tested. The module provides a single RTL function
called "skeleton()" that returns 0, and publish that function through a
Service interface which just calls it and rerturns its value.

3.1 Quickstart 
===============

From a highlevel point of view:
 - Generate your module from the skeleton
   + Make a copy of the fmodskel dir.
   + Run falconner.fal in this copy.
 - Configure, build
   + Let CMake configure for your development environment
   + Build it
 - Test the module 
   + I.e. by using the interactive falcon -i

Now you can start your code-compile-test cycle.
  

To get you going real quick, here is a list of commands you can paste
to your command line window on either
  - Unix (Linux, BSD, Solaris, MacOSX)
  - Windows

3.1.1 Generate your module from the skeleton 
---------------------------------------------

* Unix 
  If you haven't already, get the falcon sources
  
    $ git clone http://git.falconpl.org/falcon.git
  
  Copy this directory and name it i.e. mymodule
  
    $ cp -r falcon/modules/native/fmodskel mymodule
  
  Enter it and create your new module from the skeleton
  
    $ cd mymodule
    $ falconeer.fal -n MyModule -d "My brand new falcon module" -a "Mr. My Name"
  
* Windows 
  If you haven't already, get the falcon sources
  
     http://git.falconpl.org/falcon.git
  
  with a git client such as http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit.  Copy
  the directory `falcon/modules/native/fmodskel' name it
  i.e. `mymodule'. Enter it and create your new module from the skeleton
  with the falconeer utility. Other than unix, systems as MS-Windows
  will require the interpreter to load the script rather than having the
  script be executable itself. The "config.bat" script is provided as a
  sample you may modify this line
  
    falcon -w %FALCON_BIN_PATH%/falconeer.fal -n MyModule -d "My brand new falcon module" -a "Mr. my name"
  

3.1.2 Configure and build 
--------------------------

* Unix 
  Now create the directory the build takes place and configure it
  
    $ mkdir build 
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ../
  
  Entering 
  
    $ make
  
  builds your module.
  
* Windows 
  Start cmake-gui from CMake's folder in start->Programs, choose
  
    C:\Path\to\mymodule
  
  as the source and
  
    C:\Path\to\mymodule\VisualStudio
  
  as the binary directory. Hit the `Configure' button at the lower left
  corner, choose the Visual Studio version you got installed and hit
  `Configure' again.  You will get an error about CMake not finding
  
    FalconConfig.cmake
  
  and one of the two red highlighted lines in the center view says:
  
    Falcon_DIR-NOTFOUND
  
  Double clicking this line makes it editiable.  Clicking the three
  points at the very right opens Window's folder choosing dialog.
  Navigate to
  
    C:\Progam Files\Falcon\lib\falcon\cmake
  
  which contains FalconConfig.cmake and press ok.  After hitting
  `Configure' once CMake will highlight newly found falcon_* properties.
  After hitting `Configure' again nothing should be highlighted anymore
  and the `Generate' button, next to the `Configure' Button, is available.
  
  Once you've hit `Generate' you can just open the generated
  
    MyModule.sln
  
  in
  
    C:\Path\to\mymodule\VisualStudio
  
  and build the solution as usual.
  
  + NOTE: Alternative to specifing Falcon_DIR manually 
    Add
    
      C:\Program Files\Falcon
    
    to the environment variable
    
      CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
    
    or define it if not already there (which is likely). Now CMake will
    find FalconConfig.cmake automatically.
    
     

3.1.3 Test the module 
----------------------

* Unix 
  The module has been put into
  
    build/src/MyModule_fm.so
  
  To test enter build make sure to be at the mymodule rooth path and run
  
    $ export FALCON_LOAD_PATH=$FALCON_LOAD_PATH:build/src 
    $ falcon -i
  
* Windows 
  The module has been put to
  
    VisualStudio\Debug\src\MyModule_fm.dll
  
  by Visual Studio.  To test it, open a command line (start->execute and
  enter cmd) and navigate to C:\Path\to\mymodule\VisualStudio
  
    $ set FALCON_LOAD_PATH=$FALCON_LOAD_PATH;VisualStudio\Debug\src
    $ falcon -i
  
* Unix and Windows 
  Enter (without the leading >>> )
  
    >>> load MyModule
    >>> skeleton()
    0
    >>> skeletonString()
    "An internationalizable message"
